# 32-bit Reversible Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)

## Description
This project presents the design and implementation of a 32-bit Reversible Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The ALU is designed based on reversible logic concepts to reduce power dissipation caused by information loss. The design is implemented and simulated using Xilinx Vivado.

## Objective
- To design a 32-bit ALU using reversible logic concepts
- To perform basic arithmetic and logical operations
- To understand low-power and energy-efficient digital design
- To implement and verify the design using Verilog in Vivado

## Features
- 32-bit ALU architecture
- Supports arithmetic operations: Addition and Subtraction
- Supports logical operations: AND, OR, XOR
- Supports shift operations: Left Shift and Right Shift
- Dual Mode Logic support for static and dynamic operation
- Status flags: Carry flag, Zero flag, Equality flag

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Verilog HDL
- Xilinx Vivado
- FPGA-based behavioral simulation


## How to Run the Project
1. Open Xilinx Vivado
2. Create a new RTL project
3. Add all Verilog files from the `src` folder
4. Add the testbench file from the `testbench` folder
5. Run behavioral simulation
6. Observe the output waveforms and status flags

## Results
- All arithmetic and logical operations were verified successfully
- Dual Mode Logic correctly switches between static and dynamic modes
- Status flags operate correctly for different input conditions
- Simulation completed successfully without errors

## Applications
- Low-power VLSI design
- Reversible and energy-efficient computing
- Quantum and nano computing research
- Embedded and IoT hardware systems

## Conclusion
A 32-bit reversible ALU using Dual Mode Logic was successfully designed and simulated using Verilog. The project demonstrates correct functionality with reduced power dissipation concepts and can be extended to higher bit-width architectures.

## Future Work
- Extend the design to 64-bit reversible ALU
- FPGA hardware implementation
- Detailed power and delay analysis using Vivado tools
